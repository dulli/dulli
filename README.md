### Moin ðŸ‘‹

I am a space engineer from northern Germany (where we say stuff like _Moin_ instead of _Hi there_) who started coding basically as a kid and never stopped in the almost two decades since. So nowadays I mostly do it for fun and to simplify my daily life, while also learning new stuff I can apply at the job.

#### Projects

Currently, I mostly work on various smaller projects and self-hosting, as my playground to learn and apply new technologies and concepts (from new languages over _DevOps_ methods to hardware applications).

### Moin 👋

I am a ✨ space engineer ✨ from northern Germany (where we say stuff like _Moin_ instead of _Hi there_) who started coding basically as a kid and never stopped in the two decades since 🤓. So nowadays I mostly do it for fun and to simplify my daily life, while also learning new stuff I can apply at the job 🔭.

#### Projects

Currently, I mostly work on [_Deichwave_](https://github.com/dulli/deichwave), which is my playground to learn and apply new technologies and concepts (from new languages 🌱 over _DevOps_ methods ⚙️ to hardware applications 🤖).
